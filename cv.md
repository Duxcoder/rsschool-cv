### Brief information about yourself
---
   My IT history begins in 2010, when I was 13 years old, me and my friends in my spare time from school
created sites on the CMS DataLife Engine, these were entertainment sites and soft portals, and after that I swung at the ВНароде social network, of course, all these projects did not last long and were of mediocre quality, but they laid the foundation for my web education.

   After that, I often returned to this craft, created a site for my college on WordPress, and dealt with WordPress sites
as a part-time job at the university, and since 2021 I decided to leave engineering, which I was not bad at, and
to thoroughly study what has fascinated me since childhood, this is web development. Coming home from work, every day I studied HTML, then CSS, JavaScript and finally React. The field of web development turned out to be bottomless, but step by step, getting the result, I will move on and will definitely become a sought-after specialist.

### Skills
---
* HTML5 / CSS3
* JavaScript ES6+
* React 
* Styled-components / SASS / CSS Modules
* Git / GitHub
* Figma / Photoshop

### Examples
---
#### Task
> Trolls are attacking your comment section!
> A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
> Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
> For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

#### My solution
```
const disemvowel = (str) => {
  const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'];
    return  str.split('').reduce((newStr, item) => {
      return newStr += vowels.every(vowel => vowel !== item) ? item : ''
  }, '');
}
```
